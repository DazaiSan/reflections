Using diff means the amount of text to be checked reduces significantly - only need to look at the changed lines.

History of the file - enables you to retract mistakes, and look back at changes which you discarded at the time but want to consider again.

When to save? All options if possible!  Regular, after major changes, after pauses, when I choose to do it.

Pros of manual commit: I get to choose a sensible time to commit.
Cons: I might forget (or be too impatient to get on with coding!).

Multiple files?  git is aimed at projects, Google Docs at single documents.

git log - view all changes in general terms.
git diff - view specifics of changes.

Version control means you can try things out and revert if problems occur.

First git project: colour analysis in Python.
